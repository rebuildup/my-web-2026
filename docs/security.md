# Security

> my-web-2026 security policy and current controls.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

- Open a GitHub Issue tagged `security`, target a release.
- Implement the fix in a normal ticket branch
  (`<issue-number>`) or a patch release branch.
- Run `pnpm run validate:release`.
- Land via the canonical release PR flow.

For urgent / out-of-band reports (live site exploitation, credential
leaks), contact the maintainer directly via the channel listed in
`CODEOWNERS` / repository Settings → Code security before opening a
public Issue. If you find a leaked credential, assume it is
compromised: revoke and rotate immediately. Do not wait for the
patch release.

## CSRF

TanStack Start's **default CSRF middleware** is the canonical
mutation-protection mechanism for server functions. It is enabled by
default because `src/start.ts` is intentionally absent — adding a
custom `startInstance` override would disable the default
middleware, so do not add one without an ADR.

External boundary handlers under `src/http/**` are not protected by
the default CSRF middleware; they are responsible for their own
authentication and origin checks per ADR-0002.

## Test scope: local workerd vs real Cloudflare

`@cloudflare/vitest-plugin` runs SELF tests inside a local workerd
pool with **Miniflare-simulated** D1 / R2 / KV bindings. This proves:

- The Worker entry dispatches the request correctly.
- Hono handlers see the binding through `c.env.<binding>`.
- The D1 / R2 client API surface (`prepare`, `first`, `head`, …)
  behaves as documented.

It does **not** prove that real Cloudflare D1 / R2 resources
exist or are reachable. Real-resource smoke requires:

1. Real D1 `database_id` and real R2 `bucket_name` declared in
   `wrangler.jsonc`.
2. `pnpm deploy` against a Cloudflare account (or a CI deploy
   step with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`).
3. A `curl` smoke against the deployed Worker URL: `/`,
   `/api/v1/health`, `/api/v1/db/ping`, `/api/v1/media/ping`.

This real-resource smoke is part of the 0.1.0 release cut (#009
in `docs/release.md`), not the per-binding local SELF tests (#006
/ #007). Until #009 lands, "D1 / R2 binding works" means **"the
binding API is reachable in the local workerd pool"**, not
**"the production database is online"**.

## Automated checks

- Secret scanning: enabled as an asynchronous CI job (see
  `quality/profile.yaml#security_gates.secret_scanning`).
- Dependency review: deferred to a post-0.1.0 ticket.
- Code scanning (SAST): deferred.
- Container scanning: not applicable (no `Containerfile` at 0.1.0).
- Workflow YAML lint runs through `pnpm run lint:ci` inside the
  `validate` job (actionlint 1.7.12, downloaded by
  `scripts/lint-ci.mjs`). Biome does not lint `.yml`.

## Browser binaries (Playwright)

`pnpm run e2e` runs against `pnpm dev` (locally) or a deployed Worker
URL via `PLAYWRIGHT_BASE_URL`. The Chromium browser binary used by the
E2E suite is downloaded on demand:

- Locally: `pnpm run e2e:install` (`playwright install --with-deps
  chromium`). The `--with-deps` flag uses `sudo apt-get install` on
  Linux to add the system shared libraries Chromium needs
  (`libnspr4.so`, etc.) — operators should review this command before
  invoking it. The sandbox where development happens has no `sudo`,
  so `e2e:install` fails there; on CI runners `sudo` is available.
- On CI: the `Install Playwright Chromium` step in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pnpm exec playwright install
  --with-deps chromium`. The resulting `playwright-report/` artefact
  is uploaded via `actions/upload-artifact@v4` with a 7-day retention
  for triage; it contains the same HTML / traces that the local run
  would emit and must not include credentials or secrets.

Playwright is pinned in `package.json#devDependencies` and the
browser version is locked by `@playwright/test`'s `browsers` manifest
(see `pnpm exec playwright --version`). Bumping Playwright requires
running `pnpm run e2e:install` once after the lockfile update so the
new browser binary is available.
